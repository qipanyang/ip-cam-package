# Ip-cam-package
## Summary
This ip-cam package is a software support for doing deflectometry on apple device like iPhone or iPad. The apple device will be used as an external camera as well as a screen to display pattern image. All the control and settings will be left to a client on a laptop. We made the laptop client a python class as a supplement for [Merlinâ€™s open source framework](https://github.com/merlzbert/SkinScan).
